   <h2>Why HTML5 ?</h2>
   <p>HTML5 is an improved markup language that is used for presenting web content seamlessly and more attractively in World Wide Web. The feature that makes it more advanced and different from its predecessor HTML4 is the ability to support an array of multimedia contents without resorting to third-party plug-ins and APIs.</p>
   <p>HTML5 has been built, keeping in mind the fast changing browsing habits of the internet users, who access the net through mobile phones and tablets. HTML5 is written in either HTML or XHTML syntax that allows it to work with cross-platform mobile applications. HTML5 says bye-bye to third party plug-ins and APIs as it comes with inbuilt elements that play &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;. &lt;canvas&gt;, a new element added to HTML5, comes as a blessing for designers as they can now create dynamic scriptable 3D shapes and bitmap images using this feature.</p>
 <p>motionKandy is very particular in staying ahead with the ever changing world of technology. By adopting HTML5, we offer our clients a next generation experience that fulfils their innovative thoughts.</p>
